# Build Tracker

The frontier. One row per buildable section, one column per stage of the loop (see `process/PROCESS.md`). Update by hand as a section advances. This tracks **sequencing**, not defects — defects live in GitHub Issues.

**Legend:** ☐ not started · 🔶 in progress · ✅ done · — n/a yet

**Current focus:** _§5 engine built + locally tested (Test Mapping validated against real EE payload). §5 staging test script ready. §3+§4 and §5 both out for FDE staging test in parallel. Real-payload findings (sku vs item_code, no UOM field) captured as §8 open-item #4. Next buildable: §6 Idempotency/Replay or §7 Integration Contract._

## Orientation (approve-only — no build; these set framing & principles)

| Section | Spec ready | Acceptance | Approved | Built | Local test | Deployed | Team test | Live |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Introduction | ✅ | n/a | ✅ 24-May | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| 2. Architectural Principles | ✅ | n/a | ✅ 24-May | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

## Foundation (build first, in this order)

> §3 and §4 are built together as one packet (`foundation_section_3_and_4.md`): §3's client/logging/health depend on §4's log DocTypes, so connection DocTypes → §4 data model → §3 client. §5–§7 follow.

## Note on Section 0 — environment

Before Section 3 can be built, the local environment must exist: Frappe bench (v16), a site with ERPNext + India Compliance installed, the `ecommerce_super` app created via `bench new-app`, and the GitHub repo connected. If that is not yet done, it is the true first task — treat it as Section 0 and complete it before signing off Section 3.
