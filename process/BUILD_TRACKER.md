# Build Tracker

The frontier. One row per buildable section, one column per stage of the loop (see `process/PROCESS.md`). Update by hand as a section advances. This tracks **sequencing**, not defects — defects live in GitHub Issues.

**Legend:** ☐ not started · 🔶 in progress · ✅ done · — n/a yet

**Current focus:** _§5/§6/§7 built + locally tested (commits 7123669, fd955e7, c0ad884 + except-sweep — all local, awaiting push + staging redeploy). §7 verified (contract has teeth) + built the empty EasyEcom Sync Record Line child table; per-record savepoint helper deferred to §8d-Item (the first real batch — §7/A3 obligation). Formatter ghost resolved (Black/Ruff py314 except-tuple strip; pinned to py313 + global hook now lint-only). §8 split into 6 dependency-ordered packets (8a Location → 8b Channel → 8c Tax → 8d Item → 8e Customer → 8f Supplier; lookups folded in). NEXT: scope 8a Location packet (pull + FDE map, pull-only no push; resolve endpoint vs sandbox)._

## Orientation (approve-only — no build; these set framing & principles)

| Section | Spec ready | Acceptance | Approved | Built | Local test | Deployed | Team test | Live |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Introduction | ✅ | n/a | ✅ 24-May | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| 2. Architectural Principles | ✅ | n/a | ✅ 24-May | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

## Foundation (build first, in this order)

> §3 and §4 are built together as one packet (`foundation_section_3_and_4.md`): §3's client/logging/health depend on §4's log DocTypes, so connection DocTypes → §4 data model → §3 client. §5–§7 follow.

## Note on Section 0 — environment

Before Section 3 can be built, the local environment must exist: Frappe bench (v16), a site with ERPNext + India Compliance installed, the `ecommerce_super` app created via `bench new-app`, and the GitHub repo connected. If that is not yet done, it is the true first task — treat it as Section 0 and complete it before signing off Section 3.
