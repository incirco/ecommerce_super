# Build Tracker

The frontier. One row per buildable section, one column per stage of the loop (see `process/PROCESS.md`). Update by hand as a section advances. This tracks **sequencing**, not defects — defects live in GitHub Issues.

**Current focus:** _Section 3 — Authentication & Connection (the bootstrap root; build first)_

## Note on Section 0 — environment

Before Section 3 can be built, the local environment must exist: Frappe bench (v16), a site with ERPNext + India Compliance installed, the `ecommerce_super` app created via `bench new-app`, and the GitHub repo connected. If that is not yet done, it is the true first task — treat it as Section 0 and complete it before signing off Section 3.
